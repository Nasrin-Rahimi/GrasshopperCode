Sometimes code has mistakes. These mistakes are called errors or bugs.

Some errors cause the code to run incorrectly. Others break the code completely.

The line below contains an error. The second parenthesis is missing from the function call:

console.log("Time for dinner.";

A syntax error happens when there is a missing, different, or extra character. Such as an extra comma, a missing parenthesis, or a different letter.

Logic errors happen when there is a mistake in the code that produces an unexpected result.

One way to find errors in code is to add a console.log(). This allows the values of variables to be printed while the code runs.
